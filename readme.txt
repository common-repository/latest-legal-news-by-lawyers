== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have more than one widget? =

Yes, you can have as many widgets as you like. Each widget is specific to a news category.

= Are the legal posts visible to search engines? =

Yes. By picking a news category relevant to your blog's topic, you can add some relevant and up-to-date content to your site.

= How often do the legal posts update? =

This plugin fetches legal posts from multiple law firm websites and organizes them by published date. Every day we pull various posts from different websites, consolidate them, categorize and cache them. When a visitor visits your website, the plugin pulls the content from this cache that belongs to the selected legal category.

The cache is reset every 24 hours. When those 24 hours are up, the next time someone visits your site the plugin will again retrieve fresh data. So, when a new article is published on one of our legal websites in your category, all your visitors will see that headline within 24 hours.


= Does the widget 'fit' with the visual look of my site? =

The widget inherits your theme's style. It uses css for positioning and thumbnail size only. All other style elements, including font, text size and colour etc. are set by your theme. 

= What about article data? Can I get whole article contents on my blog? =

Please contact us for details on this.


== Screenshots ==
TIPS FOR PUTTING TOGETHER SCREENSHOTS
Name screenshots as screenshot-1.png, screenshot-2.png, etc.
Include at least one screenshot of the UI, and one of what it does in the front end (if it does anything there).
Keep the size of the screenshot file small.

1. Full administration/customization all from the widget panel.
2. Easily customize the widget and use multiple times on your site to align perfectly to your content. You'll see here that there is no branding on the content outside of your site theme.
3. Seamlessly integrate with your existing WordPress theme.
4. Another example with preview content turned on.
5. An example without post preview content.
6. One final example for good measure!
